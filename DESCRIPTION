Description: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, causing substantial economic losses worldwide, particularly in endemic regions such as Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. Vaccine matching, measured by the vaccine matching score (r1-value), is critical for evaluating the expected level of protection offered by FMD vaccines against circulating field strains. Traditionally, r1-values are determined through labor-intensive and high-risk serological tests, such as the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT). The FMDVacMac package provides a sequence-based, machine-learning-powered approach to predict the vaccine matching score (r1-value) directly from VP1 nucleotide sequences of FMD virus isolates. This Package offers a safer, faster, and more scalable alternative for researchers and veterinarians, facilitating effective vaccine selection and improved FMD control strategies.
